  <p>
  I got my B.Sc in Economics from Ajou University as an outstanding student in the top 10% of the major GPA. During this period, I was fascinated by the way economists view the world mathematically, and thus became interested in mathematical modeling and statistical analysis.<br><br>
  
  <b>In February 2016, I enrolled in the master's program</b> in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) to develop engineering capabilities required for data-driven research. <b>For the first one and a half years, I conducted research to mathematically model the dynamics of two-sided markets from a game-theoretic perspective and to verify them statistically.</b>  After then,  I took a break from my studies and worked as a data analyst intern at Hyundai Mipo Dockyard for half a year. During an internship, I was engaged in developing text-mining algorithms to automate documentation tasks and to analyze business insights. Completing the internship, I returned to UNIST, transferred to the combined master-Ph.D. course, and joined the lab of Prof.Chiehyeon Lim.<br><br>

  <b>I spent the first two years of Ph.D. course (Jan 2018 - Feb 2020) solving real-world problems with advanced text-mining techniques.</b> For example, I analyzed the development trends of the 4th industrial revolution and blockchain technology using topic modeling such as <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf?ref=https://githubhelp.com" target="_blank">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a> or <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2000/file/f9d1152547c0bde01830b7e8bd60024c-Paper.pdf" target="_blank">Non-negative Matrix Factorization</a>, and developed a context-aware recommender system with the leverage of <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/file/9aa42b31882ec039965f3c4923ce901b-Paper.pdf" target="_blank">Word2Vec</a>. These two studies gave me a deep understanding of Bayesian approach (e.g, Variational Inference), numerical method, and sequential modeling.</p> 
  
  <p>
  <b>For the last three years (Feb 2020 - Dec 2022), I've been focused on developing controllable sequence models, or controllable language models (CLMs),</b> not only because I think it will be increasingly important to control AI models from an end-user perspective in the future, but also because I believe that when AI is fully integrated into our lives, it can be devastating if it gets out of control. In this context, my research goal was materialized as a study of how to combine reinforcement learning (RL) and natural language generation (NLG) methods. I have conducted several studies at the intersection of RL and NLG, from application to theoretical aspects. Some studies were successfully published in top-tier conferences (e.g., KDD'21, NeurIPS'21, KDD'22), and the others are under review (e.g., EMNLP'23) or to be submitted (e.g., AAAI'24, ICLR'24).

  I dream of becoming a researcher who is willing to stand up against prejudice and inequality in the world with logical thinking and a scientific attitude.
  I am looking forward to a heart-pounding journey of research that will create a better world and promote the future with great colleagues.
  I will end this article by introducing a quote from one of my favorite scholars, Alfred Marshall:

  <h4>Research interest</h4>
  <p>
  <u>My research interest is to develop controllable language models (CLMs) for controllable sequence generation (CSG).</u> In general, I implement CLMs by treating LMs as agents and leveraging policy-based reinforcement learning (e.g., REINFORCE, TRPO, PPO, etc.,) to fine-tune the LM agents with human-instruction rewards. For the last two years of Ph.D., <u>I have published several papers proposing novel CLMs that specializes in real-world applications, </u> including diet planning [<a href="assets/publications/2021_diet_planning/paper.pdf" target="_blank">KDD'21</a>, <a href="assets/publications/2021_MIND_dataset/paper.pdf" target="_blank">NeurIPS'21</a>], operational recommendations [<a href="assets/publications/2022_recommendation_in_offline_stores/paper.pdf" target="_blank">KDD'22</a>], and drug repurposing [<a href="assets/publications/2023_working/paper.pdf" target="_blank">working paper</a>]. Figure 1 presents application examples of CSG, which can be addressed by CLMs.

  </div> 
  <div class="project-caption" style="text-align:left">
    <b>Figure.1 (Application Examples of CSG - diet planning (left) and drug repurposing (right))</b>: The data of interest is defined in a sequence format (e.g., diet sequence and compound sequence). The original sequence (i.e., a picture with the caption "before" in diet planning and "base" in drug repurposing examples, respectively) is edited into the desirable sequence whose target property (i.e., a color of diet and a target indication of drug) is controlled as intended.
  </div>

  <br>
  <p>
  <u>More recently, my research focus has shifted to establishing the theoretical foundations of CLM</u> because I believe that relying on rules-of-thumb (i.e., unprincipled) practices in out-of-control situations can be disastrous in areas that will potentially become increasingly dependent on AI (e.g., finance, medical, security, transportation, etc.) and that a theoretical understanding of the controllability of AI models can minimize this risk.
  </p>

  <p>
  <u>Figure 2 describes my recent approach to CLMs from a theoretical perspective.</u> At the core of my approach is the assumption that <u><i>"developing controllable AI is equivalent to solving multi-objective optimization."</i></u> To be specific, controlling an AI model requires it to approximate real data distribution (i.e., likelihood objective) and obey user-intended directions (i.e., reward objective) simulataneously. <u>That is, developing CLMs is a problem of searching for an optimal solution where both likelihood and reward objectives are satisfied at the same time.</u>
  </p>

  <p>
  Accordingly, <u>I hypothesized that the optimal solutions lie on the Pareto frontier,</u> as is typical for multi-objective optimization problems, <u>and that it is inevitable to sacrifice the likelihood for further increasing the reward.</u> These two hypotheses establish the theoretical foundation for the controllability of AI models, which is a unique aspect that distinguishes my approach from previous studies. You can see my work in recent papers that are <a href="assets/publications/2023_review/paper.pdf" target="_blank">under review</a> and <a href="assets/publications/2023_working/paper.pdf" target="_blank">in progress</a>.

  This research area is dissected into three elements: 1) sequential model, 2) control theory, and 3) generative framework. Therefore, the three elements must be considered in CSG research, and I usually take them into account according to the three steps as follows: 
  <ol style="PADDING-LEFT:40px">
  <li>Building the langauge models of high capacities to estimate sequential patterns (e.g., Seq2Seq, Transformers, GPT3, etc.,).</li>
  <li>Leveraging policy-based RL algorithms to induce controllability (e.g., REINFORCE, PPO, TRPO, etc.,).</li>
  <li>Optimizing the language models to be controllable using RL algorithms under the generative framework of unsupervised or self-supervised manners (e.g., AE, VAE, etc.,).</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  As mentioned above, my research boundary is grounded on the middle territory between NLG and RL. On this background, my research interest in CSGs is recently extending from real-world applications to theoretical understanding. Specifically, <b>I study the theoretical foundations of how RL and NLP techniques get intertwined and fused on the lens of Bayesian perspectives.</b> There are four reasons why I prefer the Bayesian approach:
  <ol style="PADDING-LEFT:40px">
	  <li>Bayesian methods are one of the most straightforward tools for dealing with conditional distributions.
		  <ul>
			 <li>RL is a learning framework that estimates the conditional distribution over actions given states according to the Markov decision process.</li>
			 <li>Language model describes a sequence by factorizing the joint distribution of words into the product of conditional distributions of tokens given previous tokens.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Bayesian methods provide us with a powerful backdoor, called Variational Bayes, to approximate intractable distributions difficult to estimate directly.
		  <ul>
			<li>Variational inference (VI), a mathematical framework for (approximately) doing Bayesian inference, is even computationally cheap because it can be converted to a dual problem, i.e., maximizing ELBO.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Bayesian methods imply the probabilistic status of unobserved states, and it means implicit data augmentation comes into play in the latent space.
	      <ul>
		    <li>RL requires as many observations as possible to estimate a policy that maximizes the reward.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Bayesian methods are open to introducing tricks such as marginalization so that we can easily derive useful properties such as the amount of information.</li>
  </ol>
  
  A paper titled " <a href="assets/publications/2023_levenshtein_agent/paper.pdf" target="_blank">Theoretical Principles of Controllable Generation</a> ," which deals with some of the topics related to the above four contents, was submitted to ICML'23, and is currently in the process of review. Recently, <b>I am thinking about how to introduce the concept of augmentation into CSG research in the causal perspective through the Bayesian method.</b>
