  <h4>Bio</h4>
 
  <p>
  I got my B.Sc in Economics from Ajou University as an outstanding student in the top 10% of the major GPA. During this period, I was fascinated by the way economists view the world mathematically, and thus became interested in mathematical modeling and statistical analysis.<br><br>
  
  <b>In February 2016, I enrolled in the master's program</b> in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) to develop engineering capabilities required for data-driven research. <b>For the first one and a half years, I conducted research to mathematically model the dynamics of two-sided markets from a game-theoretic perspective and to verify them statistically.</b>  After then,  I took a break from my studies and worked as a data analyst intern at Hyundai Mipo Dockyard for half a year. During an internship, I was engaged in developing text-mining algorithms to automate documentation tasks and to analyze business insights. Completing the internship, I returned to UNIST, transferred to the combined master-Ph.D. course, and joined the lab of Prof.Chiehyeon Lim.<br><br>

  <b>I spent the first two years of Ph.D. course (Jan 2018 - Feb 2020) solving real-world problems with advanced text-mining techniques.</b> For example, I analyzed the development trends of the 4th industrial revolution and blockchain technology using topic modeling such as <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf?ref=https://githubhelp.com" target="_blank">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a> or <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2000/file/f9d1152547c0bde01830b7e8bd60024c-Paper.pdf" target="_blank">Non-negative Matrix Factorization</a>, and developed a context-aware recommender system with the leverage of <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/file/9aa42b31882ec039965f3c4923ce901b-Paper.pdf" target="_blank">Word2Vec</a>. These two studies gave me a deep understanding of Bayesian approach (e.g, Variational Inference), numerical method, and sequential modeling.</p> 
  
  <p>
  <b>For the last three years (Feb 2020 - Dec 2022), I've been focused on developing controllable sequence models, or controllable language models (CLMs),</b> not only because I think it will be increasingly important to control AI models from an end-user perspective in the future, but also because I believe that when AI is fully integrated into our lives, it can be devastating if it gets out of control. In this context, my research goal was materialized as a study of how to combine reinforcement learning (RL) and natural language generation (NLG) methods. I have conducted several studies at the intersection of RL and NLG, from application to theoretical aspects. Some studies were successfully published in top-tier conferences (e.g., KDD'21, NeurIPS'21, KDD'22), and the others are under review (e.g., EMNLP'23) or to be submitted (e.g., AAAI'24, ICLR'24).
  <p/>

  <p>
  <b>In February 2023, I completed my Ph.D. in Industrial Engineering and won the best researcher award.</b> 
  
   I wrote my Ph.D dissertation on controllable sequence generation, titled <u><i>"Tackling Three Problems in Controlled Sequence Generations: Bridging Reinforcement Learning with Language Models."</i></u> &nbsp; I'm joining the Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence at UNIST as a Postdoc researcher from March 2023. Currently, I belong to <a href="https://service.unist.ac.kr/" target="_blank">the Service Intelligence Lab</a> that is led by <a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=NW7F08MAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao" target="_blank">Prof.Chiehyeon Lim</a>, my advisor whom I truly respect. 
  </p>

  <p>
  I dream of becoming a researcher who is willing to stand up against prejudice and inequality in the world with logical thinking and a scientific attitude.
  I am looking forward to a heart-pounding journey of research that will create a better world and promote the future with great colleagues.
  I will end this article by introducing a quote from one of my favorite scholars, Alfred Marshall:

    <b>Figure.1 (Application Examples of CSG - diet planning (left) and drug repurposing (right))</b>: The data of interest is defined in a sequence format (e.g., diet sequence and compound sequence).

  </div>

  <br>
  <p>
  <b>My research interest is to develop controllable language models (CLMs) for controllable sequence generation (CSG).</b> In general, I implement CLMs by treating the (large) langugage models as agents and leveraging policy-based RL (e.g., <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00992696" target="_blank">REINFORCE</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/schulman15.html" target="_blank">TRPO</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347" target="_blank">PPO</a>, etc.,) to fine-tune them with human-instruction rewards. <b>For the last two years of Ph.D., I have published several papers proposing novel CLMs that specializes in real-world applications, </b> including diet planning [<a href="assets/publications/2021_diet_planning/paper.pdf" target="_blank">KDD'21</a>, <a href="assets/publications/2021_MIND_dataset/paper.pdf" target="_blank">NeurIPS'21</a>], operational recommendations [<a href="assets/publications/2022_recommendation_in_offline_stores/paper.pdf" target="_blank">KDD'22</a>], and drug repurposing [<a href="assets/publications/2023_working/paper.pdf" target="_blank">working paper</a>].

  </div> 
  <div class="project-caption" style="text-align:left">
    <b>Figure.2 (Dual-objective Nature of CLMs (far-left) and How to achieve Pareto Improvement (far-right)):</b> The Pareto frontier is a boundary within the objective space where the set of optimal policies Ï€* belongs to. Each point represents a combination of objectives achieved by the policy at that point. The <b><span style="color:red">red</span></b> arrow indicates that we cannot increase reward without sacrificing likelihood, while the <b><span style="color:blue">blue</span></b> arrow indicates vice versa. The <b><span style="color:purple">purple</span></b> arrow and <b><span style="color:orange">orange</span></b> area denote potential direction and region, respectively, that improves both objectives simultaneously.
  </div>

  <br>
  <p>
  <b>More recently, my research focus has shifted toward establishing the theoretical foundations of CLM.</b> This is important because understanding the theoretical basis for ensuring the controllability of AI models can minimize the risks that can arise from rule-of-thumb (i.e., unprincipled) practices for out-of-control situations, which can lead to catastrophic losses amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars in many sectors, e.g., finance, medical, security, transportation, etc. 
  </p>  

  <p>
  <b>Figure 2 describes my approach to CLMs from a theoretical perspective.</b> At the core of my approach is the assumption that <b><i>"developing controllable AI is equivalent to solving multi-objective optimization."</i></b> To be specific, controlling an AI model requires it to approximate real data distribution (i.e., likelihood objective) and obey user-intended directions (i.e., control objective, or reward objective) at the same time. In other words, <b>developing CLMs is a problem of searching for an optimal solution where both likelihood and reward objectives are satisfied.</b> Accordingly, I hypothesized that <b>the optimal solutions lie on the Pareto frontier,</b> as is typical for multi-objective optimization problems, and that <b>it is inevitable to sacrifice the likelihood for further increasing the reward.</b> These two hypotheses establish the theoretical foundation for the controllability of AI models, which is a unique aspect that distinguishes my approach from previous studies. You can see my work in recent papers that are <a href="assets/publications/2023_review/paper.pdf" target="_blank">under review</a> and <a href="assets/publications/2023_working/paper.pdf" target="_blank">in progress</a>.

  This research area is dissected into three elements: 1) sequential model, 2) control theory, and 3) generative framework. Therefore, the three elements must be considered in CSG research, and I usually take them into account according to the three steps as follows: 
  <ol style="PADDING-LEFT:40px">
  <li>Building the langauge models of high capacities to estimate sequential patterns (e.g., Seq2Seq, Transformers, GPT3, etc.,).</li>
  <li>Leveraging policy-based RL algorithms to induce controllability (e.g., REINFORCE, PPO, TRPO, etc.,).</li>
  <li>Optimizing the language models to be controllable using RL algorithms under the generative framework of unsupervised or self-supervised manners (e.g., AE, VAE, etc.,).</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  
  <p>
  As mentioned above, my research boundary is grounded on the middle territory between NLG and RL. On this background, my research interest in CSGs is recently extending from real-world applications to theoretical understanding. Specifically, <b>I study the theoretical foundations of how RL and NLP techniques get intertwined and fused on the lens of Bayesian perspectives.</b> There are four reasons why I prefer the Bayesian approach:
  <ol style="PADDING-LEFT:40px">
	  <li>Bayesian methods are one of the most straightforward tools for dealing with conditional distributions.
		  <ul>
			 <li>RL is a learning framework that estimates the conditional distribution over actions given states according to the Markov decision process.</li>
			 <li>Language model describes a sequence by factorizing the joint distribution of words into the product of conditional distributions of tokens given previous tokens.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Bayesian methods provide us with a powerful backdoor, called Variational Bayes, to approximate intractable distributions difficult to estimate directly.
		  <ul>
			<li>Variational inference (VI), a mathematical framework for (approximately) doing Bayesian inference, is even computationally cheap because it can be converted to a dual problem, i.e., maximizing ELBO.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Bayesian methods imply the probabilistic status of unobserved states, and it means implicit data augmentation comes into play in the latent space.
	      <ul>
		    <li>RL requires as many observations as possible to estimate a policy that maximizes the reward.</li>
		  </ul>
	  </li>
	  <li>Bayesian methods are open to introducing tricks such as marginalization so that we can easily derive useful properties such as the amount of information.</li>
  </ol>
  
  A paper titled " <a href="assets/publications/2023_levenshtein_agent/paper.pdf" target="_blank">Theoretical Principles of Controllable Generation</a> ," which deals with some of the topics related to the above four contents, was submitted to ICML'23, and is currently in the process of review. Recently, <b>I am thinking about how to introduce the concept of augmentation into CSG research in the causal perspective through the Bayesian method.</b>

  <h4>Looking for Post-doc Position</h4>
  <p>
  Currently, <b>I am looking for a postdoctoral position related to NLP and ML research.</b> I much prefer a position in a research team rather than a development or business team, but when it comes to the research topic, my utility curve is indifferent. In other words, I am welcome to any research topics originating from both academic and business issues.
